My PhD focused on developing quantitative models for spatial prepositions. Based on these quantitative models I developed systems for automatically interpreting and generating spatial-language expressions that can be tried out online. The PhD was conducted in the context of the Tripod EU project and is available from the publications, as are a number of papers on various aspects of the work.
