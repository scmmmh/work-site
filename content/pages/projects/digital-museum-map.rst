Digital Museum Map

Museum's have created large digital collections by digitising (parts) of their
collections. In almost all cases, access to these digital collections is only
through a search box. This makes it really hard to get an overview over what
the digital collection contains and requires that the user knows exactly what
they are looking for.

The Digital Museum Map application demonstrates an alternate approach, where
an algorithm is used to automatically organise the items in the collection into
rooms and floors. This structure of floors and rooms is then made available
via the web application, enabling the user to freely browse through the digital
collection, just as they could freely wander through a physical museum.

The demonstration application linked below provides access to approximately
15,000 objects from the Victoria & Albert Museum's collections, covering a
wide range of topics.
