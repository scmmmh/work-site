The Digital Museum Map application demonstrates the use of visualisation and
browsing to enable users to freely explore a virtual museum without requiring
expert knowledge. The application enables access to a collection of approximately
2000 objects from the ancient Egypt collection at the World Museum in Liverpool,
UK.

One of the issues with digital cultural heritage is that there is more data
available than can be curated into an explorable structure by hand. The Digital
Museum Map addresses this by providing a system that takes the source digital
cultural heritage data and automatically arranges the items into floors and
rooms to create a semantic structure that can be explored.

This structure is then loaded into the web interface to provide an interface
that can easily be explored by users who are interested in cultural heritage,
but who are not experts in the field.
