Under the Surface

The digitisation of our cultural heritage has reinforced many of the biases in the modern canon across all areas of
the arts. This is not to say that all people outside the canon have been completely excluded, but they lack the
visibility of their canonical brothers. The aim of the Under the Surface project is to provide an access point where
researchers and the general public can find a collection of works that have slipped under the surface and are just
waiting to be rediscovered.

The project uses a range of automated tools to automatically link together the data that is held in a variety of
archives. The tools make use of a range of heuristics to automatically determine when two people in two archives are
likely to be the same person and then merge the data into a single access page.
