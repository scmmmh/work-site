The Explore the Stacks application demonstrates how browsing-based navigation
can be combined with search to enable an integrated experience. In the
application a collection of approximately 30,000 books from the British Library
and their illustrations can be explored.

Instead of providing a list of 1 to 10 items after the user has entered a search
keyword, it highlights those books or shelves that contain the keyword. Thus
the user can find what they are looking for, but they can also see the other
books that sit on the digital shelves.
