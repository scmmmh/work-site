The `Steinreich project <https://steinreich.uzi.uni-halle.de>`_ is an online
exhibition built to acompany a physical exhibition around the topic of stones
through history and literature.

It is built around a relatively small collection of about 140 texts and is
designed to allow visitors to freely explore the collection, rather than
having a manually curated exhibition order.
