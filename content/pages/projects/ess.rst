The Experiment Support System is a python-based web-application for building
online surveys, questionnaire's, and crowdsourcing-style experiments. It was
built based on a requirement to support both traditional and crowdsourcing-style
experiments in a single setting.

It currently supports the following features:

* **Branching** - Participants can take different paths through the experiment.
* **Data-driven Experiments** - Question content can be driven dynamically from
  data-sets. The system will automatically try to balance which data is shown
  to participants.
* **Latin-squares** - The system comes with full latin-square functionality
  for both within and between subject setups.
* **Extensibility** - The system can be extended with custom question types.
