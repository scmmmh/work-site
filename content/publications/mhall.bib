	abstract = "Significant amounts of digital material relating to heritage management and research have become available over recent years with the rise of online publications, digital archives, research infrastructures and aggregators such as Europeana. These large collections present challenges to users in discovering what items are present. Standard search paradigms for item discovery have worked well for those who are highly familiar with the collection being searched but ss collections increase in size more powerful exploration systems are required. The PATHS project (www.paths-project.eu), funded by the European Commission{\rq}s FP7 programme, brings together partners to research and develop a system to provide users with an environment in which they can sucessfully explore large, unknown collections. The project is applying language technologies to analyse and enrich manually created collection metadata, which is then exploited in the collection discovery enviroment. This paper will provide a guided tour of the PATH system and the tools developed to enable users to explore collections, collect items and form these into paths. Its goal is invite archaeologists to explore the prototype system and to evaluate the potential of the tools for implementation in research infrastructures and systems designed to present sites, monuments and artefacts to the broad public.",

To decrease this rate, a better understanding of the type of user who visits a museum web-site is required. Existing models for museum web-site users tend to focus on a small number of groups or provide little detail in their definitions of the groups. This paper presents the results of a large scale museum 	user survey in which data on a wide range of user characteristics was collected to provide well founded definitions for the user group's motivations, tasks, engagement, and domain knowledge. The results highlight that the general public and non-professional users make up the majority of users and allow us to clearly define these two groups.",

In this paper we present the results from a transaction log analysis of web server logs representing user-system interactions from the seven websites of National Museums Liverpool (NML). In addition, we undertake an exploratory cluster analysis of users to identify potential user groups that emerge from the data. We compare this with previous studies of NML website users.",

	abstract="Word-clouds are a useful tool for providing overviews over texts, visualising relevant words. Multiple word-clouds can also be used to visualise changes over time in a text. This requires that the words in the individual word-clouds have stable positions, as otherwise it is very difficult so see what changed between two consecutive word-clouds. Existing approaches have used coordinated positioning algorithms, which do not allow for their use in an online, dynamic context. In this paper we present a fast word-cloud algorithm that uses word orthogonality to determine which words can share the same space in the word-clouds combined with a simple, but fast spiral-based layout algorithm. The evaluation shows that the algorithm achieves its goal of creating series of word-clouds fast enough to enable use in an online, dynamic context.",

	abstract="Old jokes can be hard to find. Millions of jests were written, performed, and printed by past societies, and plenty of these ephemeral texts and expressions have left traces in the historical record. Unfortunately, most of them have not been preserved in a systematic and easily discoverable way. If a researcher wanted to locate historical jests about a specific topic---Victorian gags about milkmen, for instance---how would they go about doing it? Jestbooks and comic periodicals from the period represent a tiny, and often unrepresentative, fraction of surviving historical comedy. Moreover, manually browsing through these collections is a laborious process. As a result, historical jokes are underused by historians. The Old Joke Archive project aims to address this problem. We are building an open access, digital archive filled with millions of historical jokes. This chapter presents the project as a case study for reflection on the methodological challenges involved in building a repository of historical humour, especially the problem of finding, extracting, categorising, and annotating jokes using automated digital tools, and of organising the archive's metadata.",

	abstract = {This perspective paper on resource re-use intends to draw the attention of the interactive information retrieval (IIR) community to the challenges of research documentation and archiving for future use. Resources are understood as encompassing research designs, research data and research infrastructures. It proposes eight principles for improving the re-use of resources in the IIR community and presents concrete steps on how to achieve them. A five-level system for data archiving and documentation envisions increasingly open and stable documentation and access infrastructures.},

	abstract="Museum websites have been designed to provide access for different types of users, such as museum staff, teachers and the general public. Therefore, understanding user needs and demographics is paramount to the provision of user-centred features, services and design. Various approaches exist for studying and grouping users, with a more recent emphasis on data-driven and automated methods. In this paper, we investigate user groups of a large national museum's website using multivariate analysis and machine learning methods to cluster and categorise users based on an existing user survey. In particular, we apply the methods to the dominant group - general public - and show that sub-groups exist, although they share similarities with clusters for all users. We find that clusters provide better results for categorising users than the self-assigned groups from the survey, potentially helping museums develop new and improved services.",
